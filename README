This repository contains a draft of a possible successor to Akonadi 1.

It is currently entirely experimental and should not be considered a definite
replacement for Akonadi 1 at this point in time.

Discussion of the code should be done on the kde-pim at kde.org mailing list
or in #kontact on IRC.

You can find information about the overall design here:
