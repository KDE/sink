/**
 * A CardDAV resource.
 *
 * Implementation details:
 * The remoteid's have the following formats:
 * files: full file path
 * directories: full directory path
 *
 * The resource moves all messages from new to cur during sync and thus expectes all messages that are in the store to always reside in cur.
 * The tmp directory is never directly used
