without making it that explicit, we basically have the same four categories of 
data too, and explicitly exclude the use of category 3 and 4, ie user content/
activity and personal data, only technical and interaction data are allowed to 
be used (category 1 and 2).

This again brings up opt-out, which so far doesn't seem to have a chance for 
consensus. Can we defer this to when we have some more experience with the 
opt-in approach and how much participation we get with that? Or are people 
feeling this would too strongly limit what they are allowed to do in their 
applications? 

Seeing yesterday's blog from the Krita team (https://akapust1n.github.io/
2017-08-15-sixth-blog-gsoc-2017/), I'd particularly be interested in their 
view on this.

Regards,
Volker
